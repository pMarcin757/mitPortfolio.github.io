    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Philip Marcinkowski. I am attending MIT for the
      Professional Certificate in Coding for a Full Stack Development with MERN.
      I have always been interested in coding and with my current job, it has
      become big part of my role. In my current role, I mainly code in VBA, but
      I am looking to expand my knowledge of different coding languages and
      continue to improve on my skills. Before I started coding, I was a
      motorcycle technician and I am currently a mechanical engineer. As coding
      becomes more beneficial across all fields, I knew it was important to
      improve on what I currently know. I am very excited for this course and to
      improve my current skills and bring this into my everyday life.

    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
      In the past decade, my interests have centered around mechanical aspects
      which helped me go from a motorcycle mechanic to a mechanical engineer. In
      the past few years, those interests have been nurtured into a passion for
      understanding the world of coding and building things â€“ just in a new
      format. My previous roles have each taught me something unique that I
      bring to this new field. I have used design and problem solving to
      complete many challenges and that is what will help me become a better
      developer. In the past I have gained a base level of experience with
      coding websites, developing applications, and getting to know the basics
      of a few different coding languages. All of this has sparked my interest
      and brought me to MIT for their Full Stack Developer course. I am excited
      to continue to build off what I have learned and bring my engineering
      skills to develop new things.
